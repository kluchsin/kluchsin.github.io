* St. John's College, Astronomy Assistant, 2014-2015
  * I assisted in running Open Observatory Nights on a weekly basis, which involved manning the telescope, teaching students how to use the telescope, and provided facts about the objects being observed.
  * I also ran planetarium shows during the astronomy units for freshmen and sophomore math classes, which involved working the planetarium system, lecturing, and answering questions about by eye observational astronomy.
