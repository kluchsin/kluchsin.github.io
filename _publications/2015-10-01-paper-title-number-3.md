excerpt: 'Lunar water ice can be broadly categorized as belonging to one of two populations: deep, ancient, stable deposits, and shallow, transient, recent deposits. However, a  third state for lunar ice is also possible. Temporary sequestration occurs when ice is deposited into a transiently shadowed region at the lunar poles. These temporarily sequestered ice deposits are unstable over geologic time scales, but in the short term, are capable of a wide range of migration, sublimation, and retention patterns due to their thermally dependent sublimation and migration rates. We developed a model to characterize the range of possible migration and retention behaviors for temporarily sequestered ice deposits within locations with dynamic illumination conditions.'
